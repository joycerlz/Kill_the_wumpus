# Kill the wumpus!

School project - Spring 2022

Professor John Chenault

The player moves around the rooms with 2 arrows

If the player enters a room with bats, the bats fly them to another room

If the player enters a room with pits, they die and lose the game

If the player enters a room with wumpus, the wumpus might eat them, and in this case they die and lose the game.

Or the wumpus might wander to another room

The player has the choice to shoot aroows to adjacent rooms

If they shoot the wumpus, they win the game

If they used up all their arrows, they lose the game
